Almost Functional
=================

Almost functional is geared to be a simple, light weight, set of functional code for Java 1.6 - 1.7.
It's small and simple with concepts drawn from guava, Java 1.8 and world at large.

Usage
-----
Almost functional is available via the Maven central repository so the easiest route to use it is add the following to you `pom.xml` :

  		<dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.nwillc</groupId>
            <artifactId>almost-functional</artifactId>
            <version>1.3</version>
        </dependency>


Dependiencies

None, that's sort of the point. It's ~20k jar and you're done.
