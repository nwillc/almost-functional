Almost Functional
=================

Almost functional is geared to be a simple, light weight, set of functional code for Java 1.6 - 1.7.
It's small and simple with concepts drawn from guava, Java 1.8, reactive programming, and the world at large.

--------
Almost functional sources are managed in github: [https://github.com/nwillc/almost-functional](https://github.com/nwillc/almost-functional)

-------

Dependiencies

None, that's sort of the point. It's ~25k jar and you're done.
